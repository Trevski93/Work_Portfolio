We strongly encourage you to merge the NYC permit data with other data sets to contextualize your investigation. Mindful of the time we are giving you to complete this assignment, we recommend somewhat narrowly focusing your investigation. We're looking for a document that summarizes your investigation and findings."

    "Given the NYC permit data which captures the building permits issued by New York City Department Of Buildings (DOB), I was curious to see if the number of permits issued could be leveraged as a possible indicator of gentrification for a given zip code. To do so, I needed to add more context to this data set. I decided that joining the NYC Open evictions data set (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4) would prove useful here. By joining the two data sources together by zip code and year, I would be able to see if there is a correlation between the number of building permits issued and the number of evictions notices issued. My null  hypothesis is that the number of building permits issued is not correlated to the number of eviction notices issued. My alternative hypothesis is that an increased number of building permits is positively correlated with the number of eviction notices issued. I am performing a one-tailed hypothesis test for this experiment, as I am mainly interested in seeing if there is a positive correlation between building permit issuances and eviction notice issuances, which may indicate gentrification in the grander scheme.

    "To conclude, using both 2017 and 2018 data, I cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the number of building permits issued and the number of eviction notices issued. In this experiment, I used a simple linear model, because I am assuming a lot of normality in the data distribution. Otherwise, it would have been more appropriate to perform a non-parametric test."

    "One potential way to delve further into this experiment in the future would be to analyze all of the job type and work types in the building permits dataset. Choosing specifc values of these categories to perform the same experiment on may yield stronger correlations with the number of eviction notices issued. It is possible that some categories simply have no correlation and are skewing the linear model by creating \"noise\". An example of this would be perhaps the job type \"A2\" which is \"an application with multiple types of work that do not affect the use, egress, or occupancy of the building\" is much more strongly correlated with eviction notices issued than say \"DM\" which is for demolition."
